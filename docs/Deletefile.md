### **`pouch.DeleteFile` Function Explanation**

This Go code defines a function named `DeleteFile` within the `pouch` package. The primary purpose of this function is to delete a specific file from within a running Docker container. It accomplishes this by running the `rm -f` command inside the container using the `docker exec` command in the background.

#### Code Block

```go
package pouch

import (
	"fmt"
	"os/exec"
)

// DeleteFile deletes a file from within the specified Docker container.
// This operation runs the "docker exec [containerID] rm -f [filePath]" command.
func DeleteFile(containerID, filePath string) error {
	// Create the command: docker exec [ID] rm -f [file-path]
	cmd := exec.Command("docker", "exec", containerID, "rm", "-f", filePath)
	
	// Execute the command and combine standard output and standard error.
	out, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
		// In case of an error, return a descriptive error message containing
		// both the original error and the command's output.
		return fmt.Errorf("file deletion error: %v, output: %s", err, string(out))
	}
	
	// If the operation is successful, return nil (no error).
	return nil
}
```

### Function Details

The function's logic can be broken down into the following steps:

1.  **Command Creation**:
    The line `exec.Command("docker", "exec", containerID, "rm", "-f", filePath)` programmatically constructs the command `docker exec [containerID] rm -f [filePath]`, which would otherwise be run in a terminal.
    *   `docker exec`: Allows running a command inside a specified container.
    *   `rm -f`: A standard Linux/Unix command. The `-f` (force) flag ensures that the command does not return an error if the file does not exist and proceeds without asking for confirmation.

2.  **Executing the Command and Capturing Output**:
    The `cmd.CombinedOutput()` function executes the created command. In the event of an error, it facilitates debugging by capturing the error message returned by Docker (`stderr`) as well as the standard output (`stdout`).

3.  **Error Handling**:
    The `if err != nil` block checks if an error occurred during the command's execution. The `docker exec` command typically fails if the container is not running or if the specified path is a directory and the `-r` flag was not used. The function catches such errors and returns a detailed error message using `fmt.Errorf`.

4.  **Success Case**:
    If the command completes without an error (meaning the file was deleted or did not exist in the first place), the function returns `nil`, indicating the operation was successful.

### Parameters

*   `containerID (string)`: The ID or name of the Docker container from which the file will be deleted.
*   `filePath (string)`: The absolute path of the file to be deleted **inside** the container (e.g., `/app/config.json`).

### Return Value

*   `error`: The function returns an `error` value.
    *   If the operation is successful, this value is `nil`.
    *   If the container is inaccessible or another `docker exec` error occurs, an error object is returned containing information about why the command failed.

### Important Notes

*   For this function to work, the system executing the code must **have Docker installed**, and the `docker` command must be available in the system's `PATH`.
*   The target container (specified by `containerID`) must be in a **running state** when the function is called.

### Usage Example

Let's say we want to delete the file `/var/log/nginx/access.log` from within a container named `my-web-server`.

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	// You need to import the 'pouch' package according to your project structure.
)

func main() {
	containerID := "my-web-server"
	fileToDelete := "/var/log/nginx/access.log"

	// Call the pouch.DeleteFile function
	err := pouch.DeleteFile(containerID, fileToDelete)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Could not delete the file inside the container: %v", err)
	}

	log.Printf("File '%s' in container '%s' was deleted successfully.", fileToDelete, containerID)
}
```
