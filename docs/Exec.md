### **`pouch.Exec` Function Explanation**

This Go code defines a general-purpose function named `Exec` within the `pouch` package. The primary purpose of this function is to run any desired command inside a running Docker container and return the command's output (both standard output and standard error) as a string. This provides a powerful and flexible method for programmatically using the `docker exec` command.

#### Code Block

```go
package pouch

import (
	"fmt"
	"os/exec"
)

// Exec runs the given command inside a Docker container with the specified ID.
// It returns the combined standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr)
// of the command as a single string.
func Exec(id string, command []string) (string, error) {
	// Create the base arguments for "docker exec [id]" and
	// append the command to be executed to these arguments.
	args := append([]string{"exec", id}, command...)
	
	// Create the Docker command.
	cmd := exec.Command("docker", args...)

	// Execute the command and capture both standard output and standard error.
	out, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
		// In case of an error, return a detailed error message containing
		// both Go's error object and the command's output.
		return "", fmt.Errorf("exec error: %v\noutput: %s", err, out)
	}

	// If successful, return the command's output as a string.
	return string(out), nil
}
```

### Function Details

1.  **Argument Combination**:
    The line `args := append([]string{"exec", id}, command...)` forms the foundation of the function.
    *   First, the slice `[]string{"exec", id}` prepares the beginning of the `docker exec [containerID]` command.
    *   Then, using the `append` function and the `...` operator, all elements of the `string` slice passed as the `command` parameter (the `command_to_run` and its `arguments`) are added to this list. For example, if `command` is `[]string{"ls", "-la", "/app"}`, the `args` slice becomes `[]string{"exec", "my-container", "ls", "-la", "/app"}`. This structure allows for building commands safely (without the risk of shell injection).

2.  **Command Execution**:
    The complete command object to be run is created with `cmd := exec.Command("docker", args...)`. The `cmd.CombinedOutput()` function executes this command and, one of its key features, combines standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) into a single byte slice (`out`). This guarantees that error messages are captured even when a command fails.

3.  **Error Management**:
    The `if err != nil` block catches error conditions, such as when a command terminates with a non-zero exit code. In this case, a highly informative error message is generated with `fmt.Errorf`. This message contains both the Go-level error (`err`) and the output produced by the command itself (`out`), which greatly simplifies the debugging process.

4.  **Successful Output**:
    If the command runs successfully (with an exit code of 0), the captured output (`out` byte slice) is converted to a string with `string(out)` and returned along with a `nil` error.

### Parameters

*   `id (string)`: The ID or name of the Docker container inside which the command will be run.
*   `command ([]string)`: A slice of strings containing the command and its arguments to be run inside the container. The first element of the slice should be the command itself, and subsequent elements should be its arguments.

### Return Value

*   `string`: The combined standard output and standard error text resulting from the command's execution.
*   `error`:
    *   If the operation is successful, this value will be `nil`.
    *   If the `docker exec` command fails (e.g., if the container is not running or the command returns an error), an error object with detailed information is returned.

### Important Notes

*   For this function to work, **Docker must be installed** on the system, and the `docker` command must be accessible in the system's `PATH`.
*   The target container specified by `id` must be in a **running state**.

### Usage Example

To list all environment variables inside a container named `my-app` (using the `env` command):

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	// You need to import the 'pouch' package according to your project structure.
)

func main() {
	containerID := "my-app"
	commandToRun := []string{"env"} // Just the command, no arguments.

	// To list the /etc directory in the container:
	// commandToRun := []string{"ls", "-l", "/etc"}

	output, err := pouch.Exec(containerID, commandToRun)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to run command in container: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("Output from container '%s':\n%s", containerID, output)
}
```
