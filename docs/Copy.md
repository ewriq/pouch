### **`pouch.CopyToContainer` Function Explanation**

This Go code defines a function named `CopyToContainer` within the `pouch` package. The primary purpose of this function is to copy a file or directory from the host machine to the inside of a running Docker container. It accomplishes this by executing the `docker cp` command in the background.

#### Code Block

```go
package pouch

import (
	"fmt"
	"os/exec"
)

// CopyToContainer copies a file or directory from the host machine to the specified Docker container.
// This operation is performed using the "docker cp" command.
func CopyToContainer(ID, HostPath, TargetPath string) error {
	// Create the "docker cp [HostPath] [ContainerID]:[TargetPath]" command.
	cmd := exec.Command("docker", "cp", HostPath, fmt.Sprintf("%s:%s", ID, TargetPath))
	
	// Execute the command and combine standard output and standard error.
	out, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
		// In case of an error, return a more descriptive error message
		// containing both the original error and the command's output.
		return fmt.Errorf("docker cp error: %v, output: %s", err, string(out))
	}
	
	// If the operation is successful, return nil (no error).
	return nil
}
```

### Function Details

1.  **Command Creation**:
    The line `exec.Command("docker", "cp", HostPath, fmt.Sprintf("%s:%s", ID, TargetPath))` uses Go's `os/exec` package to create a new command object. This is equivalent to the `docker cp [HostPath] [ContainerID]:[TargetPath]` command that would be run in a terminal.

2.  **Executing the Command and Capturing Output**:
    The `cmd.CombinedOutput()` function executes the created command. It captures both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) into a single byte slice (`out`). If the command does not execute successfully, it returns an `error` object (`err`). This method is very useful for debugging because it allows us to see the error message provided by Docker when the command fails.

3.  **Error Handling**:
    The `if err != nil` block checks if any error occurred during the command's execution. If there is an error (`err` is not `nil`), the function creates a detailed error message with `fmt.Errorf`. This message includes the original error (`%v`, `err`) and the output produced by the command (`%s`, `string(out)`). This allows the calling code to easily understand the reason for the failure.

4.  **Success Case**:
    If the command completes successfully, the function returns `nil` (no error), indicating that the operation was successful.

### Parameters

*   `ID (string)`: The ID or name of the Docker container to copy to.
*   `HostPath (string)`: The path of the file or directory on the host machine that will be copied to the container.
*   `TargetPath (string)`: The destination path inside the container where the file or directory will be copied.

### Return Value

*   `error`: The function returns an `error` value.
    *   If the operation is successful, this value is `nil`.
    *   If the `docker cp` command fails, an error object is returned containing information about why the command failed.

### Dependencies

For this function to work correctly, the system executing the code must **have Docker installed**, and the `docker` command must be available in the system's `PATH`.

### Usage Example

Let's assume we want to copy the local file `./config.yaml` to the `/etc/app/` directory inside a container named `my-app-container`.

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	// You need to import the 'pouch' package according to your project structure.
	// For example: "github.com/your-username/your-project/pouch"
)

func main() {
	containerID := "my-app-container"
	hostFile := "./config.yaml"
	containerPath := "/etc/app/"

	// Call the pouch.CopyToContainer function
	err := pouch.CopyToContainer(containerID, hostFile, containerPath)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to copy to container: %v", err)
	}

	log.Println("File successfully copied to the container!")
}
```
