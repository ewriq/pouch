### **`pouch.List` Function Explanation**

This Go code defines a function named `List` within the `pouch` package. The primary purpose of this function is to list **all** Docker containers present on the system (both running and stopped). It accomplishes this by running the `docker ps -a` command in the background and returns the command's raw text output as a string.

#### Code Block

```go
package pouch

import (
	"fmt"
	"os/exec"
)

// List lists all Docker containers on the system (both running and stopped).
// It returns the raw output of the "docker ps -a" command.
func List() (string, error) {
	// Create the "docker ps -a" command. The -a flag ensures that all containers,
	// including stopped ones, are listed.
	cmd := exec.Command("docker", "ps", "-a") 
	
	// Execute the command and combine standard output and standard error.
	out, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
		// In case of an error, return a descriptive error message containing
		// both the original error and the command's output.
		return "", fmt.Errorf("listing error: %v, output: %s", err, string(out))
	}
	
	// If the operation is successful, return the command's output as a string.
	return string(out), nil
}
```

### Function Details

1.  **Command Creation**:
    The line `exec.Command("docker", "ps", "-a")` prepares a command object to run the `docker ps -a` command in the terminal.
    *   `docker ps`: Typically lists only running containers.
    *   `-a` (`--all`): This flag makes the command include stopped containers in the list. This function uses this flag by default to provide information about all containers on the system.

2.  **Executing the Command and Capturing Output**:
    The `cmd.CombinedOutput()` function executes the created command. It combines the command's standard output (usually the container table) and standard error (any potential error messages) into a single byte slice (`out`). This is very useful for capturing error messages, especially if the Docker service is not running or if another issue occurs.

3.  **Error Handling**:
    The `if err != nil` block checks whether the command executed successfully. For example, if the Docker daemon (service) is not running, the `exec` package will return an error. In this case, the function creates a detailed error message containing both the original Go error (`err`) and the output from Docker (`out`) to make it easier to understand the cause of the failure.

4.  **Success Case**:
    When the command completes without an error, the raw output from the byte slice is converted to a string with the `string(out)` expression and is returned along with a `nil` error value. The returned text is identical to what you would see when running `docker ps -a` in the terminal.

### Parameters

*   This function takes **no** parameters.

### Return Value

*   `string`: On success, the raw text output listing all containers in the format they would appear in the terminal.
*   `error`:
    *   If the operation is successful, this value is `nil`.
    *   If the Docker service cannot be reached or another `docker` error occurs, an error object with detailed information is returned.

### Dependencies

For this function to work as expected, **Docker must be installed** on the environment where the Go code is running, and the `docker` command must be in the system's `PATH`.

### Usage Example

The following example shows how to use the `List` function to list all containers on the system and print the result to the console.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	// You need to import the 'pouch' package according to your project structure.
)

func main() {
	// Call the pouch.List function to get the list of all containers
	containerList, err := pouch.List()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Could not list containers: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Println("All Docker Containers on the System:")
	// Directly print the raw text returned by the function
	fmt.Println(containerList)
}
```
