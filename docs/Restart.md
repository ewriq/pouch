### `pouch.Pull` Function Description This operation is performed by executing the `docker pull` command in the background and reports the success status of the operation with an `error` value.
	

```
// Pull downloads the specified Docker image from a remote registry.
func Pull(image string) error {
    // Create the “docker pull [image]” command.
    cmd := exec.Command(“docker”, “pull”, image)

	// Run the command and combine the standard output with the standard error.
    // This allows you to capture both the output (such as a progress bar) and any potential errors.
    output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
    if err != nil {
        // In case of an error, return an error message containing both the Go error and the Docker output
		// an explanatory error message containing both the Go error and Docker's output.
        return fmt.Errorf(“pull error: %v\n%s”, err, string(output))
    }

    // If the operation is successful, return nil (no error).
    return nil
}
```

### Function Details

1.  **Command Creation**:
    The line `exec.Command(“docker”, ‘pull’, image)` programmatically creates the command `docker pull [image_name]` to be executed in the terminal. The `image` parameter can be an image name such as “ubuntu:latest” or “redis”.

2.  **Executing the Command and Capturing the Output**:
    The `cmd.CombinedOutput()` function executes the created command. While the `docker pull` command is running, it writes information such as download progress to standard output and error messages to standard error. `CombinedOutput` collects both streams into a single byte array (`output`). This is very effective for capturing the specific error message returned by Docker in case of an error (e.g., “repository not found”).

3.  **Error Checking**:
The `if err != nil` block checks whether the command completed successfully. If the image cannot be found, there is no internet connection, or there is a problem with the Docker registry, the `docker pull` command ends with a non-zero exit code and the `err` variable is not `nil`. In this case, the function returns a rich error message containing both the general error at the Go level (`err`) and the detailed output from the Docker CLI (`output`) using `fmt.Errorf`.

4.  **Successful Case**:
If the image is successfully downloaded, the `docker pull` command completes with an exit code of 0 and the `err` value is `nil`. The function returns `nil` in this case to indicate that the operation was successful.

### Parameters

* `image (string)`: The name and tag of the Docker image to be pulled (downloaded). For example: `“alpine:latest”`, `“postgres:14”`.

### Return Value

* `error`: The function returns an `error` value.
* If the image download is successful, this value is `nil`.
* If the image cannot be found, network connection issues occur, or another Docker error occurs, an error object containing detailed information is returned.

### Dependencies

*   For this function to work, **Docker must be installed** on the system where the Go code is running, and the `docker` command must be in the system's `PATH` variable.
*   An active **internet connection** is required because the image will be pulled from a remote registry.

### Usage Example

An example showing how to use the `Pull` function to pull the latest version of the `alpine` image to the system:

```go
package main

import (
    “log”
    // You need to import the ‘pouch’ package according to your project.
)

func main() {
    imageToPull := “alpine:latest”

    log.Printf(“Pulling ‘%s’ image...”, imageToPull)

    // Call the pouch.Pull function
    err := pouch.Pull(imageToPull)
	if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf(“Image pull failed: %v”, err)
    }

    log.Printf(“‘%s’ image pulled successfully!”, imageToPull)
}
```
