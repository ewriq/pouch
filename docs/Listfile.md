### `pouch.ListFiles` Function Description

This Go code defines a function named `ListFiles` within the `pouch` package. The primary purpose of this function is to list the contents (files and directories) of a specific directory within a running Docker container. It performs this task by executing the `ls -l` command inside the container via the `docker exec` command and returns each line of the output as an element of a string array.
	“strings”)

```
// ListFiles lists the contents of a directory in a specified Docker container
// in ‘ls -l’ format.
// Each line is returned as an element of a string array.
func ListFiles(containerID, containerPath string) ([]string, error) {
	// Build the command: docker exec [ID] ls -l [directory-path]
    // The “ls -l” command provides a detailed (long) list format.
    cmd := exec.Command(“docker”, “exec”, containerID, ‘ls’, “-l”, containerPath)
	
	// Run the command and combine the standard output with the standard error.
    out, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
        // In case of an error, return an explanatory error message containing both the original error and the command output.
        return nil, fmt.Errorf(“File listing error: %v, %s”, err, string(out))
    }

	// Trim leading and trailing spaces from the command output,
    // then split the output into a string array by line.
    lines := strings.Split(strings.TrimSpace(string(out)), “\n”)

    // Return the resulting line array.
    return lines, nil
}
```

### Function Details

1.  **Command Creation**:
    The line `exec.Command(“docker”, “exec”, containerID, ‘ls’, “-l”, containerPath)` creates the command to be executed. This command runs the `ls -l [containerPath]` command inside the specified container (`containerID`). The `-l` flag provides a long list format containing detailed information such as file permissions, owner, size, and last modification date.

2.  **Command Execution and Error Handling**:
The `cmd.CombinedOutput()` function executes the command and collects both the standard output (file list) and standard error (error messages) into a single `[]byte` array. If `docker exec` returns an error (e.g., the container is not running or the specified directory does not exist), the `err` variable will not be `nil`, and the function will return a `nil` array along with a detailed error message.

3.  **Processing the Output**:
This is the most important step of this function.
*   `string(out)`: The raw byte output is converted to text (string).
*   `strings.TrimSpace(...)`: Unnecessary spaces and newline characters at the beginning and end of this text are removed.
    *   `strings.Split(..., “\n”)`: The cleaned text is split by newline characters (`\n`) and converted into a string array (`[]string`). As a result, each line of the `ls -l` command becomes a separate element of this array.

4.  **Successful Return**:
If the operation is successful, the `lines` array containing each line of the file list and a `nil` error value are returned.

### Parameters

*   `containerID (string)`: The ID or name of the Docker container in which the files will be listed.
*   `containerPath (string)`: The path of the directory to be listed **inside** the container (e.g., `/app`, `/var/log`, etc.).

### Return Value

*   `[]string`: If the operation is successful, a string array containing each line of the output of the `ls -l` command is returned. The first line of the array typically contains information such as “total <number of blocks>”. Each line contains information such as file permissions, owner, and size.
* `error`:
* If the operation is successful, this value is `nil`.
    *   If the container is not running, the directory does not exist, or another `docker` error occurs, an error object containing detailed information is returned.

### Important Notes

*   For the function to work, **Docker must be installed** and running on the system.
* The container specified by the target `containerID` must be **running**.

### Usage Example

To list the configuration files in the `/etc/nginx/conf.d` directory of a container named `nginx-server`:

```go
package main

import (
    “fmt”
    “log”
    // You need to import the ‘pouch’ package according to your project.)


func main() {
    containerID := “nginx-server”
    directoryPath := “/etc/nginx/conf.d”

	// Call the pouch.ListFiles function to retrieve the directory contents
    fileList, err := pouch.ListFiles(containerID, directoryPath)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf(“Could not list files in the container: %v”, err)
    }

	fmt.Printf(“Contents of the ‘%s’ directory in the ‘%s’ container:\n”, containerID, directoryPath)

// The returned array is the raw output of ‘ls -l’. The first line usually contains ‘total’ information.
// You can skip this line if you want.
	for i, line := range fileList {
    if i == 0 && strings.HasPrefix(line, “total”) {
        fmt.Printf(“(Total block information: %s)\n”, line)
        continue
    }
    fmt.Println(line)
}
}
```
