### `pouch.Logs` Function Description It performs this task by running the `docker logs` command in the background and returning the command's output as raw text.
```
// Logs retrieves all log records from the Docker container with the specified ID.
func Logs(id string) (string, error) {
    // Create the “docker logs [id]” command.
    cmd := exec.Command(“docker”, “logs”, id)

	// Run the command and combine the standard output and standard error.
    // The docker logs command already combines these two streams.
    out, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
    if err != nil {
        // In case of an error, return an explanatory error message containing both the original error and the command output.
		// in an explanatory error message.
        return “”, fmt.Errorf(“logs error: %v, output: %s”, err, string(out))
    }

    // If the operation is successful, return the logs as a string.
    return string(out), nil
}
```

### Function Details

1.  **Command Creation**:
    The line `exec.Command(“docker”, “logs”, id)` creates a command object to run the command `docker logs [containerID]` in the terminal. This command retrieves all data written to the standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`) streams by a container while it is running.

2.  **Running the Command and Capturing the Output**:  
    The `cmd.CombinedOutput()` function runs the created command. Since the `docker logs` command naturally provides both `stdout` and `stderr` logs together, `CombinedOutput` is an ideal method for capturing this output in its entirety. The entire output of the command is collected in a byte array named `out`.

3.  **Error Checking**:
    The `if err != nil` block checks whether there was a problem while executing the command. The most common errors include not finding a container with the specified ID or the Docker service (daemon) not running. If an error occurs, the function returns a rich error message containing both the Go-level error (`err`) and the error message generated by the Docker CLI (`out`).

4.  **Successful Status**:
If the command runs successfully, the log data in the byte array is converted to text (string) using the `string(out)` expression and returned to the place where the function was called, along with the `nil` error value.

### Parameters

* `id (string)`: The ID or name of the Docker container from which the logs will be retrieved.

### Return Value

* `string`: If the operation is successful, the raw text containing all the accumulated logs of the container.
* `error`:
    *   If the operation is successful, this value is `nil`.
    *   If the container cannot be found or there is a problem with the Docker service, an error object containing detailed information is returned.

### Dependencies

For this function to work, **Docker must be installed** on the system running the code, and the `docker` command must be accessible through the system's `PATH` variable.

### Usage Example

An example showing how to use the `Logs` function to retrieve all logs from a container named `my-api-server` and print them to the console:

```go
package main

import (
    “fmt”
    “log”
    // You need to import the ‘pouch’ package according to your project.)


func main() {
    containerID := “my-api-server”

	// Retrieve the container's logs by calling the pouch.Logs function
    logOutput, err := pouch.Logs(containerID)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf(“Container logs could not be retrieved: %v”, err)
    }

	fmt.Printf(“‘%s’ Container Logs:\n”, containerID)
    fmt.Println(“---------------------------------”)
	fmt.Println(logOutput)
fmt.Println(“---------------------------------”)
}
```
